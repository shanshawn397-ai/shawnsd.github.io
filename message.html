Happy birthday to the best man I've ever known. Thankyou for being such a kind and understanding father who guides me and who has
            always been by my side through everything. 
            Thankyou for being such a great father and mentor to each of us.
            To my guide,first love, superhero, with love💗. <br><br>
            I just wanted you to know that you’re on my mind. I admire the way you carry yourself and 
            the effort you put into everything you do, even when things aren’t loud or visible to others. 
            You don’t need to have all the answers right now—what matters is the heart and intention you move with, 
            and you’ve always had that. Take your time, breathe, and trust yourself a little more. And please remember, 
            you’re not alone—there are people who believe in you and quietly stand by you. 
            You mean more than you realise, and I genuinely believe good things are finding 
            their way to you, slowly but surely
